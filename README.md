The project is to understand the factors that contribute most to employee attrition and create a model that can predict if a certain employee will leave the company or not. The approach includes Standard Machine Learning pipeline of Knowing the problem, Loading the data, data cleaning, Preprocessing, Exploration, Modelling, Iterating and Insights. The k-means clustering is used to explore the data. The project is modelled using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines and CART Implementation techniques.
The data used for the project is placed in HR_comma_sep.csv file
The code using R programming can be found in HR_Analytics.R and HR_Analytics_code.pdf
The Report and results are placed in HR_Analytics_Report.pdf
